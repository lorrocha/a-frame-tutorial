# First Look at A-Frame
This is a repository of the files generated to accompany a talk/tutorial on [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).

The presentation slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O0y5WjAJxYq1StNHofLExKlBtZFizgoqkpDorxx3kR8/edit?usp=sharing)

## HOW TO FOLLOW ALONG
When the code examples begin, there will be the name of an html file in the bottom left corner. Simply open the file with the corresponding name in the pages directory in an A-Frame supported browser of your preference to follow along with the presentation.

Clone this repository locally, and make sure your browser has its [Same-Origin policy disabled](#IMAGE-ERRORS-aka-"Help,-I-don't-see-the-skybox!").

You can open the file using your terminal by using the command `open html_file_name`. Or you can drag and drop the file into your browser window.

## FAQ

### IMAGE ERRORS aka "Help, I don't see the skybox!"
If you're running this as a local file, you will find that you may have trouble loading the image asset because of the [CORS protocol](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/).

For the purposes of this tutorial, disable the Same-Origin policy in your browser or get an extension that will do it for you. Here's an extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/) and here is one for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi?hl=en).

### MOVING AROUND aka "Help, I don't see the red box!"
Use the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' or the directional arrow keys on your keyboard to move the camera in the demo. Hold down left mouse button and drag and drop to move the direction the camera is looking to.

It's tricky, but the 'box' step added in web-vr-3.html is added to the left of the user, to intentionally demonstrate the 3D space and controls
