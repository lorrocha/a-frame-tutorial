# First Look at A-Frame
This is a repository of the files generated to accompany a talk/tutorial on [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/).

The presentation slides can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1O0y5WjAJxYq1StNHofLExKlBtZFizgoqkpDorxx3kR8/edit?usp=sharing)

## HOW TO FOLLOW ALONG
When the code examples begin, there will be the name of an html file in the bottom left corner. Simply open the file with the corresponding name in the pages directory in an A-Frame supported browser of your preference to follow along with the presentation.

You can open the file using your terminal by using the command `open html_file_name`. Or you can drag and drop the file into your browser window.
